# double_quadruple_precision_simulation
This project is a high-precision simulation tool built with Python and Streamlit. It investigates the real-world impact of floating-point rounding errors by comparing how different bit-depth architectures (24-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit) handle the accumulation of drift over extreme durations.
